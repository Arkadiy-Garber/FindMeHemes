# FindMeHemes
Scripts for identifying and extracting genes with heme-binding motifs from a genome

## Dependencies
python3
Prodigal (optional, if you provide contigs)

This script will take as input a genome in the form of predicted gene-calls (open reading frames) in amino acid format.
You can also provide a genomes as a set of contigs, at which point Prodigal will be used for gene prediction.
